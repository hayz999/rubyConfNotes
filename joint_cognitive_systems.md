# Fundamentals of Joint Cognitive Systems
Joint cognitive systems is a part of cognitive systems engineering

Nearly all forms of meaningful or challenging work is joint activity

There are cognitive costs to coordination

Parties engaged in joint activities have different goals and priorities

### Foundational ideas:
- All work is cognitive work
- Work is distributed across humans and machines in a join cognitive systems
- Machine “co-workers” can be assholes
- We can design and develop better tools for software engineers
- Human conditions: we cannot change the human condition but we can change the conditions humans work in
- Safety can be encoded in the design of technology
- Operators just have to follow procedures to get the work done
- Accidents can be avoided by having more automation
- Automation is necessary in modern systems but also introduces new challenges and risks

### Joint cognitive approach:
- Takes a systems-view of people/technology/work, in the real world
- Instead of humans are better at, machines are better at, thinking things humans need machines for and things machines need humans for
- The unit of analysis is the cooperation between agents engaged in joint systems

### Cognitive work:
- What is happening?
- What should be happening?
- What does it mean for my purpose?
- Why is it happening in this way?
- What will happen next?
- How slowly or quickly will that happen?
- What options do I have? What resources do I have?
- Need to be asking questions constantly when working in a joint cognitive system

### What makes a machine a team player?
- Provides context with alerts to make it more understandable to the humans interacting with it
- Serves as a cognitive aid to the human counterpart
- Supports functions not just specified tasks
- Supports human judgment and expertise
- Ability to be interrogated
- Has affordances
- Aids anomaly detection
- Clear under conditions of time pressure, stress, and uncertainty
- Smooth transitions
